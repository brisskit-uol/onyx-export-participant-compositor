	     NB: The composition phase is only allowed during the generation of test data.
	    
	     The selection construct is used to choose those parts of a questionnaire which
	     will be swapped between participants.
	    
	     There are three selection constructs:
	     (1) hint:
	         Any variable which can be matched partly to the hint string will be included.
	         If the hint is 'abcde', the match will be on '*abcde*'.
	         The string is case sensitive.
	         More than one hint can be included in a select. They act as logical OR's.
	     (2) exclude:
	         If the hint is too general, some accidental associations may be included.
	         These can be explicitly excluded. Hint and exclude work in tandem.
	     (3) explicit:
	         If no other way is possible, you can use explicit to give the exact match.
	         This is case sensitive. Multiple explicit constructs can be used.
